## Hey there 👋

I'm Greg Byrne and I'm a software engineer from Ireland. 

### Professionally 👔 
I've helped develop business solutions in mission-critical software that affects millions of people. 
Over the years, I've flipped from working with back-end and front-end technologies, helping architect functionality for business solutions, involved with large techincal sales bids, helped clients directly with support and acted as technical team lead. 

### Free time 🔭 
I like to build personal projects that allow me to learn new things as well as try share that learning through blogging and writing.</p>

### Where am I? 📫 
You can find me on various places on the interweb, but a good starting point is [gregbyrne.ie](https://www.gregbyrne.ie)
